# Ontologies used by PhenoImageShare

## Image Ontologies

[The Biological Imaging Methods ontology](https://github.com/PhenoImageShare/fbbi) (fbbi) has been used extensively by FlyBase and the Cell Image library.  We are updating this ontology PhenoImageShare in order to use it for annotating imaging methods, sample preparation and visualisation methods.

##Â Stage ontologies

We use [OBO Foundry](http://www.obofoundry.org/) stage ontologies, which are collectively hosted [here](https://code.google.com/p/developmental-stage-ontologies/).

## Anatomy ontologies

We use [OBO Foundry](http://www.obofoundry.org/) anatomy ontologies including:

[Mouse Anatomy]()
[Drosophila anatomy ontology]()

## Phenotype ontologies

We use [OBO Foundry](http://www.obofoundry.org/) phenotype ontologies including:

[Mammalian Phenotype]()
