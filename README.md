PhenoImageShare
===============

PhenotypeImageShare is a phenotype image annotation, sharing and discovery platform. 

It will provide a toolkit for complex image annotation, sharing, discovery and query from federated biological images supporting phenotype description. Feasibility will be demonstrated using high throughput phenotype images from KOMP2 and IMPC, histology images of adult tissues early post-natal (EUCOMMTOOLS) and embryo (EMAGE). Images will be a combination of 3D (OPT, uCT, uMR) and high-resolution histology sections. All tools will be applicable to other model systems

This project is a collboration between the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) and Heriot-Watt University Edinburgh, Medical Research Council, Human Genetics Unit Edinburgh.
